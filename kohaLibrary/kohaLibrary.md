## Introduction

  
The Koha library project integrates with Koha library APIs, enabling users to access library functionalities through a secure login process. Users can navigate to the Koha library portal, enter their credentials, and, upon successful authentication, utilize features such as searching for resources, managing their accounts, and borrowing materials. This integration streamlines library operations and enhances user experience.
