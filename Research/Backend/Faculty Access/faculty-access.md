1. **Standard Access Window**  
   Faculty members are typically allowed to fill research forms from Monday to Thursday each week. This ensures a structured timeline for form submissions to be reviewed and processed for inclusion in the Chronicle.

2. **Emergency Access Provision**  
   In cases of emergency, the Admin has the option to grant special access to faculty members outside the regular submission window. This access is available for Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of the current week as needed.

3. **Admin-Controlled Access**  
   The Admin controls the approval of emergency access based on individual requests, allowing faculty to submit their forms during these extended days if granted.

4. **Research Form Submission for Chronicle Inclusion**  
   Once the access is granted, faculty members can complete and submit their research forms. These submissions are then reviewed and, if approved, are included in the next edition of the Chronicle.
