1. **Credential Entry and Validation** When the user enters their username and password, the system first validates that both fields are not empty. 

 2. **Authentication Check** The credentials are then verified through the LMS’s authentication project. If the credentials are valid, the system sends a success message along with tokens.

 3. **Token Storage in Redis** The tokens are stored in Redis to facilitate the ongoing authentication process for subsequent user requests.
