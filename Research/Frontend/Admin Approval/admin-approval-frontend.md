The Admin has the authority to approve, reject, or request edits to the forms before they are fetched in the chronicle.

1. **Form Submission by Faculty**  
   When faculty members fill out a research form, it is submitted to the Admin for review and verification.

2. **Admin Verification Process**  
   The Admin reviews the entire form to ensure the information is accurate and complete. Before making a decision, the Admin can view all details of the form to verify its validity.

3. **Approval or Rejection**  
   If the Admin finds that the information is accurate and valid, the form is approved. If any discrepancies or invalid information are found, the Admin can reject the form.

4. **Inclusion in Chronicle**  
   Approved forms are included in the Chronicle when it is created, with the validated information being fetched for inclusion.

5. **Faculty Edits After Rejection**  
   If the form is rejected, faculty members are given the opportunity to edit the form and resubmit it for further review by the Admin. The form can be approved or rejected again based on the updated details.

6. **Admin's Final Decision**  
   The Admin has the authority to approve or reject the form after reviewing it, ensuring that only accurate and validated data is included in the Chronicle.
