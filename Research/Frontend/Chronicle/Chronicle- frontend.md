1.  **Chronicle Creation by Chronicle Admin**

The Chronicle Admin compiles the chronicle using various components, including the Vice Chancellor’s Note, approved research forms, Teaching Excellence submissions, Meeting Stakeholders updates, Branding & Advertisement forms, and the "News of the Week" contributed by the librarian. Each of these elements is combined to create a comprehensive chronicle.

  

2.  **Weekly Data Collection**

The chronicle is created based on data of current week, ensuring that the content is timely and relevant.

  

3.  **Vice Chancellor Approval**

Once the chronicle draft is complete, it is sent to the Vice Chancellor for review and approval.

  

4.  **Email Scheduling**

After approval by the Vice Chancellor, the Chronicle Admin schedules an email to distribute the chronicle to its intended recipients.
